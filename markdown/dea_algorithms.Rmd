## Differential Expression Analysis with MS-DAP

In the MS-DAP manuscript, the authors compared multiple algorithms designed for differential expression analysis of proteomics datasets. Upstream of the DEA analysis, datasets were all normalized with VSN (variance stabilizing normalization) combined with protein-level mode-between normalization (MBProt). See the "Normalization" documentation for more information about VSN and MBProt. Benchmarking of DEA algorithms was performed on a variety of label-free proteomics datasets including DDA & DIA and data collected from multiple instruments and vendors. Here we introduce the available DEA tools and highlight their strenghts/weaknesses to guide selection of the desired tool.

## Available DEA Algorithms and Considerations for Use

DEA analysis can be performed eiter at the peptide level, or following roll-up to the protein level. Generally speaking, the more recently developed peptide-level algorithms have shown to have reduced bias and generate more correct precision estimates than the summarization/protein-level models (see [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/pr501223t) and [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/pr900610q) for discussion). However, in the MS-DAP manuscript both protein (DEqMS) and peptide-level (msEmpiRe, MSqRob) algorithms showed similar performance when applied to VSN+MBProt normalized datasets. Minor differences in performance were seen for DDA datasets, with msEmpiRe being slightly more performant than the other two methods.

One major practical difference in the approaches is computation time: DE testing with protein-level approaches is performed in seconds (per contrast), while peptide-level algorithms took anywhere from 10-30 min per contrast.

### Protein-Level Models

__eBayes__: MS-DAP wrapper for the 'eBayes' function from the [`limma` package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). Originally developed for RNA-sequencing data, eBayes applies a moderated t-statistic to each row of a `protein*sample` data matrix. Must be used at protein level, since t-statistics are calculated per row, and there is not a straightforward way to translate peptide-level statistics to protein level. In MS-DAP, peptide-to-protein rollup is performed using MaxLFQ algorithm, and eBayes is applied to the resulting protein-level data. This method can take input of covariates for modeling.

__DEqMS__: MS-DAP wrapper for the `DEqMS` [package](https://github.com/yafeng/DEqMS), [Manuscript](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620349975?pes=vor), which is an extension of limma eBayes function specifically modified for application to proteomics datasets. The main modification is to the calculation of the empirical-Bayesian prior variance, which "describes one's prior expectation of the variance for a gene from the variance observed for all the other genes". Rather than the default use of an estimated fixed prior distribution for all genes, a modified approach provided an "intensity-based moderated t-statistic (IBMT)" to account for a gene expression intensity-dependent prior variance. DEqMS modified the IBMT function to change the regression covariate from gene expression to peptide spectral matches (PSM) or peptide count. This is done to allow for better estimation of within-group variance, as quantification accuracy is greatly dependent on the number of PSMs or peptides detected for a protein. For label-free datasets, protein abundances are summarized from peptides, so the number of peptides per protein is used as a covariate to estimate prior variance.

In benchmarking, the DEqMS authors noted that compared to limma eBayes, DEqMS is more stringent when testing the significance of differential expression for proteins quantified by only 1-2 PSMs/peptides. Additionally, DEqMS performs better than eBayes for small sample size experiments, due to its improved estimation of protein variance.


### Peptide-Level Models

__msEmpiRe__: Wrapper for the msEmpiRe [package](https://github.com/zimmerlab/MS-EmpiRe), [Manuscript](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31235637/), which is a peptide-level DEA algorithm designed to explicitly account for noise in peptide fold-changes between conditions. Protein intensities have to be inferred from corresponding peptide-level intensities, but different peptides from a protein can differ by orders of magnitude from each other for various technical reasons unrelated to protein abundance in the sample (for example, ionization efficiencies, ion supression from co-eluting ions, etc.). In the msEmpiRe manuscript benchmarking, msEmpiRe had similar detection of DE proteins as MSqRob, however, msEmpiRe had improvements in error rate control compared to MSqRob, particularly in cases with strong fold changes.

Note, msEmpiRe does not perform linear regression and therefore does not allow for inclusion of additional covariates to control for batch effects etc. Thus, msEmpire may not be the best choice in cases where there are known strong batch effects that may be better analyzed with MSqRob or DEqMS.

__MSqRob__: Wrapper for the MSqRob [package](https://github.com/statOmics/MSqRob), [Manuscript](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26566788/). This algorithm improves upon peptide-level linear regression modeling by implementing ridge regression, empirical Bayes variance estimation, and M-estimation with Huber weights. This approach is used to improve upon problems inherent to peptide-level linear modeling, including overfitting, sample-to-sample variability and outliers. The result is improved protein-level log2-fold change estimates as compared to peptide linear modeling and increased sensitivity to detect true positives compared to protein-level DE algorithms.
