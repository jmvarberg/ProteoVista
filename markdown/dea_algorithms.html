<h2>Differential Expression Analysis with MS-DAP</h2>
<p>In the MS-DAP manuscript, the authors compared multiple algorithms
designed for differential expression analysis of proteomics datasets.
Upstream of the DEA analysis, datasets were all normalized with VSN
(variance stabilizing normalization) combined with protein-level
mode-between normalization (MBProt). See the “Normalization”
documentation for more information about VSN and MBProt. Benchmarking of
DEA algorithms was performed on a variety of label-free proteomics
datasets including DDA &amp; DIA and data collected from multiple
instruments and vendors. Here we introduce the available DEA tools and
highlight their strenghts/weaknesses to guide selection of the desired
tool.</p>

<h2>Available DEA Algorithms and Considerations for Use</h2>
<p>DEA analysis can be performed eiter at the peptide level, or
following roll-up to the protein level. Generally speaking, the more
recently developed peptide-level algorithms have shown to have reduced
bias and generate more correct precision estimates than the
summarization/protein-level models (see <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/pr501223t">here</a> and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/pr900610q">here</a> for
discussion). However, in the MS-DAP manuscript both protein (DEqMS) and
peptide-level (msEmpiRe, MSqRob) algorithms showed similar performance
when applied to VSN+MBProt normalized datasets. Minor differences in
performance were seen for DDA datasets, with msEmpiRe being slightly
more performant than the other two methods.</p>
<p>One major practical difference in the approaches is computation time:
DE testing with protein-level approaches is performed in seconds (per
contrast), while peptide-level algorithms took anywhere from 10-30 min
per contrast.</p>

<h3>Protein-Level Models</h3>
<p><strong>eBayes</strong>: MS-DAP wrapper for the ‘eBayes’ function
from the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html"><code>limma</code>
package</a>. Originally developed for RNA-sequencing data, eBayes
applies a moderated t-statistic to each row of a
<code>protein*sample</code> data matrix. Must be used at protein level,
since t-statistics are calculated per row, and there is not a
straightforward way to translate peptide-level statistics to protein
level. In MS-DAP, peptide-to-protein rollup is performed using MaxLFQ
algorithm, and eBayes is applied to the resulting protein-level data.
This method can take input of covariates for modeling.</p>
<p><strong>DEqMS</strong>: MS-DAP wrapper for the <code>DEqMS</code> <a href="https://github.com/yafeng/DEqMS">package</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620349975?pes=vor">Manuscript</a>,
which is an extension of limma eBayes function specifically modified for
application to proteomics datasets. The main modification is to the
calculation of the empirical-Bayesian prior variance, which “describes
one’s prior expectation of the variance for a gene from the variance
observed for all the other genes”. Rather than the default use of an
estimated fixed prior distribution for all genes, a modified approach
provided an “intensity-based moderated t-statistic (IBMT)” to account
for a gene expression intensity-dependent prior variance. DEqMS modified
the IBMT function to change the regression covariate from gene
expression to peptide spectral matches (PSM) or peptide count. This is
done to allow for better estimation of within-group variance, as
quantification accuracy is greatly dependent on the number of PSMs or
peptides detected for a protein. For label-free datasets, protein
abundances are summarized from peptides, so the number of peptides per
protein is used as a covariate to estimate prior variance.</p>
<p>In benchmarking, the DEqMS authors noted that compared to limma
eBayes, DEqMS is more stringent when testing the significance of
differential expression for proteins quantified by only 1-2
PSMs/peptides. Additionally, DEqMS performs better than eBayes for small
sample size experiments, due to its improved estimation of protein
variance.</p>

<h3>Peptide-Level Models</h3>
<p><strong>msEmpiRe</strong>: Wrapper for the msEmpiRe <a href="https://github.com/zimmerlab/MS-EmpiRe">package</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31235637/">Manuscript</a>, which
is a peptide-level DEA algorithm designed to explicitly account for
noise in peptide fold-changes between conditions. Protein intensities
have to be inferred from corresponding peptide-level intensities, but
different peptides from a protein can differ by orders of magnitude from
each other for various technical reasons unrelated to protein abundance
in the sample (for example, ionization efficiencies, ion supression from
co-eluting ions, etc.). In the msEmpiRe manuscript benchmarking,
msEmpiRe had similar detection of DE proteins as MSqRob, however,
msEmpiRe had improvements in error rate control compared to MSqRob,
particularly in cases with strong fold changes.</p>
<p>Note, msEmpiRe does not perform linear regression and therefore does
not allow for inclusion of additional covariates to control for batch
effects etc. Thus, msEmpire may not be the best choice in cases where
there are known strong batch effects that may be better analyzed with
MSqRob or DEqMS.</p>
<p><strong>MSqRob</strong>: Wrapper for the MSqRob <a href="https://github.com/statOmics/MSqRob">package</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26566788/">Manuscript</a>. This
algorithm improves upon peptide-level linear regression modeling by
implementing ridge regression, empirical Bayes variance estimation, and
M-estimation with Huber weights. This approach is used to improve upon
problems inherent to peptide-level linear modeling, including
overfitting, sample-to-sample variability and outliers. The result is
improved protein-level log2-fold change estimates as compared to peptide
linear modeling and increased sensitivity to detect true positives
compared to protein-level DE algorithms.</p>
